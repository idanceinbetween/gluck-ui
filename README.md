# glūck-ui
I built [the first version of glūck](https://github.com/idanceinbetween/gluck-client) as my final project at coding bootcamp. Since then I have luckily got a job at a wonderful company, and have now picked up this project again as to practise the skills that I am learning on the job.

The client side code of both versions uses React, and the improvement of this version rely on: 
- TDD (strict!)
- Typescript
- Trunk-based development
- Experimenting with the use of gitmoji

I also plan to set up a CI/CD pipeline in the near future for deployment.
